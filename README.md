Make and commit changes

Click the README.md file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click Commit changes button.

Step 4. Open a Pull Request
Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.
